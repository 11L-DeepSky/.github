# 🛩️ DeepSky: AI-Powered Airspace Intelligence

Welcome to **DeepSky**—where we bring **AI** to the skies! 🚀  
Our mission? **Enhancing airspace safety** for small aircraft by detecting traffic ahead, reducing collision risks, and making the sky a safer place for everyone.  

## ✈️ What We Do  
We use cutting-edge AI to analyze **real-time video streams** and detect aircraft in flight and provide almost **instant voice feedback** to the pilots.
Think of it as an extra pair of AI-powered eyes, scanning the skies while pilots focus on flying.  

## 📂 Our Repositories  

🔹 **[deepsky-client](https://github.com/11L-DeepSky/deepsky-client)**  
  - The user-friendly interface for pilots to **visualize detected aircraft** in real-time.  
  - Built with React Native for **on-the-go airspace awareness**.

🔹 **[rtsp-frame-capture](https://github.com/11L-DeepSky/rtsp-frame-capture)**  
  - Captures and processes live RTSP **video** frames from cameras mounted on aircraft.
  - The **essential** data pipeline for our **AI-powered** **detection** system.  

## 🌟 Why DeepSky?  
- **Low-latency** **AI** powered **voice** agent 🗣️
- AI-powered detection 🧠🚀  
- **Real-time traffic awareness** ⏱️🔎  
- **Increased safety for small aircraft** 🛫✅  

## Other information
- Demo was created on live data captured from the [X-Plane 12 flight simulator](https://www.x-plane.com/)
